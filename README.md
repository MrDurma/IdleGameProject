# Simple Idle Game
#### To run the game use command "flask run", make sure you read requirements.txt
#### NOTE: Game does not look very pretty at the moment, my main focus was functionality. This game is still being developed.
#### Description:
This is a Simple Idle Game that was written in Python and HTML. This project is using Flask, Bootstrap, CSS, Sqlite3, jQuery and Jinja.

#### NOTE: I've decided to switch from Flask to Django Framework, I will post update here once I finish.
